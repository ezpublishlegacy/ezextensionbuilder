# to fix

. rewrite fat_dist task not to use eZComponents for creating the tarball

. rewrite custom inclusion of ezcomponents sources - use composer method for autoload

. split main pakefile in 3 (bootstrapper, real pakefile, class) since we do not use anymore 1-file install

# general

. ezfind: should not pack manual in odf format => improve exclude list w. depth

. allow config file to be in other directory than ./pake

. allow extension to build self:
  - currently it replaces tokens within pakefile.php files
  - it should build the zip used on the website for auto-upgrades (besides the full zip), or
  - improve upgrade task not to need a separate zip (see description later)

. allow to build many extensions in a single call
  (workaround: use extension dependencies with a fake 'root' extension)

. add support for different dir schemas for extensions providing packages? nb: better if we can do it without that...

. add more detailed documentation of expected coding/file layouts standards

. move all the business logic in php classes outside of pakefile

. copy task names from http://jenkins-php.org/ (as duplicate names for current tasks)


# new tasks

. add a task to generate .sql files from .dba

. add some code quality checks (possibly from other extensions)
  - validity of php files
  - proper php opening tag for ini files, absence of charset tag (or only utf8 recommended)
  - proper naming of ini files
  - php coding style
  - css validation (via w3.org validator? see http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/api.html)
  - translation checking (see eg. checks done in ez 4.5 cli script)

. add metrics-generating task. See:
  - phpmd
  - codesniffer
  - phpqatools.org

. add support for launching testsuite tests

. changelog generation task: if it's not there, build it from git/svn commit messages
  (also update ez package with that info)

. deployment task (eg. to upload extension to projects.ez.no or github)
  - might need first some changes on projects.ez.no site

. a task that checks for presence of update sql scripts (needs to have access to previous version sources too)

. css/js minification task (not very important since we have ezjscore)

. add an apply-patch task to apply patch files at build time

. add tasks to generate sample ezinfo.php and extension.xml files

. add task that displays the tool's own changelog


# improve tasks

. add auto-update task to std build tasks, except when using --skip-upgrade-check option (?)

. init task that starts with a file untar

. add support for generating more docs:
  . manual from docbook
  . api docs from sami, phpdoc besides doxygen
  . rst docs in other dirs?

. do not try to replace tokens in doxygen-generated css

. dist task: allow to specify .tar.bz2 output format

. clean task: allow to only delete extension dir, not complete build dir

. update-extra-files: also use EXTENSION_NAME and EXTENSION_COPYRIGHT tokens

. allow username/password for svn/git tasks

. packaging task:
  . allow more files to be put in package docs besides LICENSE & README
  . grab dependencies from extension.xml and put them into package file
  . verify that package.xml is valid xml & compliant with the package schema
  . better regexps to always update package.xml even on iterated "build --skip-init" runs
