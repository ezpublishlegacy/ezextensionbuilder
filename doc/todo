# to fix

. rewrite fat_dist task not to use eZComponents for creating the tarball

. simplify configuration for reports: only set 1 dir for all outputs
. allow config file to specify doc dir for plain docs
. test running report generation tasks against ezp (5, legacy, community) instead of an extension
. when looking around for composer dirs, test value of COMPOSER_XXX env vars (see http://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#composer-home)

# general

. ezfind: should not pack manual in odf format => improve exclude list w. depth

. allow ezextensionbuilder to build self (does it means anything at all now?)

. allow to build many extensions in a single call
  (workaround: use extension dependencies with a fake 'root' extension)

. add more detailed documentation of expected coding/file layouts standards

. move all the business logic in php classes outside of pakefile.php

. copy task names from http://jenkins-php.org/ (as duplicate names for current tasks)

. add support for different dir schemas for extensions providing packages? nb: better if we can do it without that...

# new tasks

. add more code quality checks (possibly from other extensions/tools/packages)
  - proper php opening tag for ini files, absence of charset tag (or only utf8 recommended)
  - proper naming of ini files
  - css validation (via csslint - needs node.js - or w3.org validator? see http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/api.html)
  - js validation (via jshint - needs node.js )
  - translation checking (see eg. checks done in ez 4.5+ cli script)
  - hhvm-wrapper?
  - yui-something? (look at ezcs)
  
. add more metrics-generating tasks. See f.e. phpqatools.org, http://jenkins-php.org/
  - graphs from phpdepend

. add support for launching testsuite tests => needs a full-fledged ez installation ?

. add a task to generate .sql files from .dba ones

. changelog generation task: if it's not there, build it from git/svn commit messages
  (also update ez package with that info)

. deployment task (eg. to upload extension to projects.ez.no or branch + tag it github)
  - might need first some changes on projects.ez.no site

. a task that checks for presence of update sql scripts (needs to have access to previous version sources too)

. css/js minification task (not very important since we have ezjscore)

. add tasks to generate sample ezinfo.php and extension.xml files

. add task that displays the tool's own changelog

. add an apply-patch task to apply patch files at build time (???)

# improve tasks

. all report tasks: allow exclusion of directories

. pakefile download task: allow silent overwrite (for updates)

. init task that starts with a file untar

. add support for generating more docs:
  . manual from docbook
  . api docs from sami, phpdoc2, (phpdox?) besides doxygen
  . rst docs in other dirs?

. do not try to replace tokens in doxygen-generated css files

. dist task: allow to specify .tar.bz2 output format

. clean task: allow to only delete extension dir, not complete build dir

. update-extra-files: also use EXTENSION_NAME and EXTENSION_COPYRIGHT tokens

. allow username/password for svn/git tasks

. packaging task:
  . allow more files to be put in package docs besides LICENSE & README
  . grab dependencies from extension.xml and put them into package file
  . verify that package.xml is valid xml & compliant with the package schema
  . better regexps to always update package.xml even on iterated "build --skip-init" runs
