. tar archive not working on windows with ezc version <= 2009.2.1

. problems on windows running init with tortoisegit and tortoisesvn (locked files/dirs cannot be deleted)

. the extension is not 100% able to build self (it will replace erroneous things in pakefile.php files)

. if an old version of pakefile.php is used to bootstrap, it will download the latest version of the pake lib, but not upgrade self, which might result in a broken install (so broken that later task "upgrade" will not work). A bootstrap should always include an upgrade
